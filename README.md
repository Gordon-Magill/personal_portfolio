# Gordon Magill - Personal Portfolio Site

This is a personal portfolio site to host interesting projects that I've worked on and practice frontend design. A perpetual work in progress.


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a chemical engineer by formal training, but have developed an interest in software development, machine learning, and automation over my career.
I want to blend these experiences and knowledge to do what no individual developer or engineer would be capable of doing in their respective silos.
